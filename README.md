# TFMe: Time-Frequency-Memory-enhanced Transformer for Anomaly Detection
A specialized Transformer model designed to detect anomalies in car-parking environments by leveraging time, frequency, and memory enhancements.

## Prerequisites
We highly recommend using Conda to manage your environment and dependencies.
### Ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

```bash
pytorch= 2.4.1+cu118
python= 3.8.20
cudatoolkit= 11.8.0
cudnn= 9.10.1.4
numpy= 1.24.1
scikit-learn= 1.3.2
```

## Usage
The __TFMe_Model_Architecture__ notebook contains the complete proposed model architecture, along with step-by-step instructions for applying the model to a dataset.
